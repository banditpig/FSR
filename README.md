# Streams and Feedback Shift Registers for 'Random' numbers.

Basic implementation of Feedback shift registers with various 'taps' from the context of an 
infinite Stream, this provides 'random' numbers and with suitable 'taps' into the register quite long
cycles can be created. 
 
The generated values are integers but can easily be normalised into [0,1].
